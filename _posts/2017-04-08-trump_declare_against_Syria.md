美国同胞们：  
My fellow Americans,

本周二，叙利亚独裁者巴沙尔·阿萨德使用致命的神经性毒剂向无辜的居民发起化学武器攻击。阿萨德夺取了很多无助的生命，包括男人、女人和儿童。这种攻击对于受害者来说是一种缓慢而残忍的死亡，甚至连稚嫩的婴儿都会因这野蛮的暴行而失去生命。没有一个上帝的孩子应该遭受这种恐惧的威胁。  
On Tuesday, the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror.

就在今晚，我命令一支定向武装部队打击叙利亚军用机场，正是在这里，他们发动了化学攻击。打击和阻止致命化学武器的使用和传播，攸关美国的国家安全利益。毫无争议，叙利亚使用了禁用的化学武器，违反了《禁止化学武器公约》，而且忽视了联合国安理会的要求。此前试图改变阿萨德行为的多年努力全部失败，而且是惨败。随着难民危机的不断加深，以及该地区的稳定性持续遭到破坏，这已经威胁到美国和其同盟。     
Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States, to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemicals Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad’s behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically. As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies. 

今晚，我呼吁所有文明国家加入我们的行列，以阻止叙利亚的杀戮和流血事件，同时以结束所有类型的恐怖主义。面对这个陷入困境的世界，我们向上帝祈求智慧，为那些受伤的人以及逝者的灵魂祈祷。我们希望，只要美国能够主张正义，和平和和谐最终将会胜利。  
Tonight, I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We ask for God’s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world, We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed. And we hope that as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will in the end, prevail.

晚安，愿上帝庇护美国和全世界。谢谢。  
Good night and God bless America and the entire world. Thank you!
